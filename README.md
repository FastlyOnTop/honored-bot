Source code for the discord bot honored

This bot was made by carter ( @x6l ) and was meant to be a shitty remake of bleed. 
Although this bot was discontinued due to the owner realizing that the bot its self was garbage..
This bot is pretty simple to set up.. ( steps below )

# Set up guide

1. Create a VPS
2. Create a folder called "rewrite" within the root directory
3. Ensure you're on node version 22 or higher
4. Run **npm install** ( this will download all needed files )
4. Use pm2 to host the bot
